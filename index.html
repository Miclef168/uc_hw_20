        <h2>Case Study Overview</h2>
        <p><b>Time Span:</b> 3 Weeks</p>
        <p><b>Overview:</b> Design a mobile application to meet a growing pain point of users with a focus on usability
            and heuristics.</p>
        <p><b>Problem Description:</b> More pet owners are looking to provide safe and nutritious food for their pets.
            However, information on the internet is unreliable at best. gourPet is a mobile application that provides
            articles, products, and recepies that can be tailored for specific pet diets. All provided information is
            verified by veterinarians for credibility.</p>

        <h2>Research and Analysis</h2>
        <p><b>Methodology:</b> Five user interviews were conducted over two days, and an open survey was sent out by
            social media for one week.</p>
        <p><b>Significant Findings:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>58.2% of users interviewed and surveyed have conducted additional research beyond veterinarian
                reccommendations for information on pet diets.</li>
            <li>54.5% of users interviewed and surveyed consider information found internet untrustworthy.</li>

                marketing that didn't have any scientific backing to the claims of what you should feed your pets.”</p>

                we don't carry it anymore. And the manufacturer was like thinking about not making it anymore. So we had
                to have the vet help us find like the alternative brand. But it was really stressful because like, we're
                rationing food."</p>

        <h2>Ideation</h2>
        <p><b>Affinity Diagram Results:</b> Users pain points were primarily focused around cost, accuracy of
            information, and availability of product.</p>
        <p><b>Feature Prioritization:</b> Based on the findings, the decisions was made to focus on access to product
            information, the ability to customize information based on pet type, and alternative diet options such as
            homemade recipes. Users did not express enough intrest in research articles to make the feature a prioroty,
            but one worth including in the wireframed design.

        <h2>Wireframine</h2>
        <p><b>Sketches:</b> We initially started with several simple sketches meant to give us a framework. Early on, we
            decided to go with a bottom navbar in order to provide a simple interface where users could use one finger
            to interact with the application. It was important for us to make this as easy to use as possible, which led
            to significant chances to the design of the app as we iterated on our designs.</p>

        <h4>From Concept to Prototype</h4>
        <h3>The User Profile</h3>
        <p>The user flow for our profile set up needed to allow the user to customize pet profiles as well, in order to
            take advantage of the custom searches for dietary information that would be provided. It was decided to have
            an onboarding process not only for the application, but for creating a pet profile as well. We wanted to be
            able to allow the user to feel as though the app was doing everything it could to make infromation for their
            pet as transparent and detailed as possible.</p>

        <h4>From Concept to Prototype</h4>
        <h3>Information Searching</h3>
        <p>We initally split up the search options for recipes, articles, and products, wanting to allow the use to know
            they were searching for the right information. Users would also be able to favorite and save recipes,
            articles, and products in order to be able to find them easier. We had chosen a recipe book icon for the
            recipes, but it was later removed after user testing.</p>

        <h2>Iterating the Navigation</h2>
        <p>Aftr the initial round of user testing, we quickly discovered we were increasing the cognitive load of the
            users by separating the search functions. Users indicated they had no idea what the recipe book was used
            for. It was a great lesson in pattern recognition and subtractive thinking. We combined the search functions
            into the magnifying glass icon and created a nav that would allow the user to switch between search modes.
            This also had the benefit of simplifying the nave bar.
        </p>
        <p>Additional changes were made, but this was by far the most significant.</p>

        <h2>Reflections and Next Steps</h2>
        <p>After this project, the idea of subtractive thing was made clear, and my team and I realize the age old
            saying "less is more". While the project was only three weeks, it was a valuable experience in avoiding
            assumptions, or at least always testing assumptions with research. As far as next steps, my team decided to
            practice and experiment with branding and style. It was not apart of the challenge, but a basic color
            palette was created and applied to take some of the lo-fi wireframes to mid-fi.
